  <h2><code>git config --global user.name ""</code></h2>  
  <p>This command sets your global username. Typically you should do it after instaling Git, but you can change it in any time. This is important, because every your commit must contain this information. The command sets your username for all your future commits, but if you want to set other username for a some project you can use this command without "--global" in the project directory.</p>

  <h2><code>git reset HEAD</code></h2> 
  <p>The command reverts a Git repository to a previous commit. However, before using it, everyone have to check "git status" is clean, since it throws away all your uncommitted changes. Here the "HEAD" means the current branch. You can also use "git reset HEAD^" which reverts to previous commit. The command "git reset HEAD^^" may revert to the last two commits.</p>

  <h2><code>gitk -all</code></h2> 
  <p><strong>gitk</strong> by itself displays changes in a repository or a selected set of commits(includes visualizing the commit graph, showing information related to each commit, and the files in the trees of each revision).
  <br>Option <strong>-all</strong> shows all refs (branches, tags, etc.).<br><b>Sources:</b> <a href=https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk>https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk</a></p>

  <h2><code>git diff --staged</code></h2>  
  <p>git diff [<options>] --cached [<commit>] [--] [<path>…​]
   This form is to view the changes you staged for the next commit relative 
   to the named <commit>. Typically you would want comparison with the 
   latest  commit, so if you do not give <commit>, it defaults to HEAD. 
   If HEAD does not exist and <commit> is not given, it shows all staged 
   changes. --staged is a synonym of --cached. </p>

  <h2><code>git branch -d "branch"</code></h2>  
  <p>The command delets branch, which name is given in paranthesis; Eg git branch -d "thisBranch" will delete the branch named "thisBranch"</p>

  <h2><code>git config --global color.ui true</code></h2>  
  <p>Colors output.You can create a section [color] in your ~/.gitconfig with e.g. the following content
[color]
  diff = auto
  status = auto
  branch = auto
  interactive = auto
  ui = true
  pager = true
You can also fine control what you want to have coloured in what way, e.g.
[color "status"]
  added = green
  changed = red bold
  untracked = magenta bold
[color "branch"]
  remote = yellow</p>

  <h2><code>git commit "filename"</code></h2>  
  <p>It is used to create a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the given log message describing the changes. The new commit is a direct child of HEAD, usually the tip of the current branch, and the branch is updated to point to it (unless no branch is associated with the working tree, in which case HEAD is "detached").</p>
  <p>Explanation of <strong>"filename"</strong>: when files are given on the command line, the command commits the contents of the named files, without recording the changes already staged. The contents of these files are also staged for the next commit on top of what have been staged before.</p>

  <h2><code>git add .</code></h2>  
  <p><b>git add</b> adds modified files to the Git index (staging area, like a queue). Those files will be commited later. 
  <br>Option <strong>'.'</strong>  in Git 2.X is the same as <strong>[-A/--all]</strong> and adds all files in entire working tree.

  <h2><code>git checkout "branch"</code></h2>  
  <p><b>git checkout</b> allows to navigate between branches created by git branch. Checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch. Git then records all new commits on that branch. </p>

  <h2><code>git blame -C "filename"</code></h2>  
  <p><b>git blame</b> Annotates each line in the given file with information from the revision which last modified the line. Optionally, start annotating from the given revision.
  <br>When specified one or more times, -L restricts annotation to the requested lines.
  <br>The origin of lines is automatically followed across whole-file renames (currently there is no option to turn the rename-following off). To follow lines moved from one file to another, or to follow lines that were copied and pasted from another file, etc., see the -C and -M options.
  <br>The report does not tell you anything about lines which have been deleted or replaced; you need to use a tool such as git diff or the "pickaxe" interface briefly mentioned in the following paragraph.
  <br> For example: "git blame -L 40,60 foo" or "git blame -L 40,+21 foo" both give you the origin of lines 40-60 in file foo.
